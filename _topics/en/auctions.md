Market trade is full of strategy. 
Buyers have to know the real costs of the sellers in order to push the price down. 
Sellers have to know the real valuations of the buyers in order to pull the price up.

The research on [double auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_auction)s aims 
to make trade easier and more peaceful by creating *truthful* mechanisms -
creating rules of trade in which  each buyer and each seller
are best-off when acting according to their true valuations without any strategic
considerations. You should not need to spy over the other agents in order to know what their valuations are.
