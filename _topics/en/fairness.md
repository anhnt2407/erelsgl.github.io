As the world becomes more crowded, we need methods for fair division of land. The starting point 
of my research is the classic challenge of [Fair cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_cake-cutting).
My goal is to generalize this framework in various ways in order to make it more applicable to division of land.
